# web-practice-brand-project

This small web page was created during my summer break as a personal practice exercise to improve my front-end development skills.  
It helped me explore different layouts, styling techniques, and basic eCommerce website functionalities.

## About the Project

The goal of this project was to:
- Practice writing clean and structured HTML
- Experiment with CSS styling and responsive design

The project is currently unfinished and remains a work-in-progress, but it reflects my enthusiasm for self-learning and sharpening my skills outside of coursework.
